Espresso: S-expr for LLVM
=========================

Espresso is an S-expression-based functional programming language, and
a compiler for that language, currently being prototyped. It is
influenced by the Lisp family of languages (the s-expr syntax), as
well as ML and Haskell (single assignment, type inferencing,
modification only allowed for reference types).

The compiler will compile Espresso source files into LLVM IR, which is
a high-level assembly language with SSA. llc (the LLVM compiler) can
then be used to compile down to native code on several platforms.
